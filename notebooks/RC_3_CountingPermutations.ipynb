If a left-double-edge piece is placed in a left-double-edge position, it will be oriented \"right-side up\". If a left-double-edge piece is placed in a right-double-edge position, it will be oriented \"upside-down\". And likewise for right-double-edge positions.

Therefore, there are 0 degrees of freedom due to orientation of double edge pieces.\n",
